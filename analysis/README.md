The modle selection algorithms are mostly implemented in the [fitters.R] file.
The first step, in which we selected the initial pool of variables is in the
[univariate.R] file. The multivariate steps are implemented in the files
[multivariate_step1.R] through [multivariate_step5.R].

All files depend on the datasets that are generated in the [../data] folder.
